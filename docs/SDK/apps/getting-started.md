# Getting Started

Apps are services and products that can be integrated into your platform to provide additional functionality. Each app is expected to contain a **collection of actions** that offer specific units of functionality for your product.

Apps are broadly categorized into two types:

- **Private Apps**
- **Public Apps**

**Private Apps** are services used internally within your workspace. These apps are developed by your team to provide services within your platforms or products. They can range from microservices that communicate with each other using Ductape to standalone services that share data and provide functionality within your workspace.

**Public Apps** are services made available to third parties for integration, allowing them to build their own layers of logic on top of these services. Public Apps are published by workspaces to share their functionalities with others and enable external developers to enhance their own products.

## App Components

- **Actions**
