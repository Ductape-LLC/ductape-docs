# Getting Started

Integrations in Ductape are a powerful combination of app actions and custom reusable components that enable you to deliver advanced functionality within your applications. By leveraging integrations, you can create new custom logic using reusable components while incorporating actions from multiple sources. This approach allows you to build sophisticated features and workflows without the need to develop everything from scratch.

With Ductape, integrations provide a seamless way to extend your product capabilities, offering greater flexibility and control over your development process. Whether you're combining data from different APIs, orchestrating complex business processes, or enhancing your microservices architecture, integrations allow you to efficiently build and maintain robust solutions tailored to your specific needs.

### Apps

Integrations in Ductape provide an interface for adding apps to your workflows. These apps can be private from your workspace or public from the marketplace. To use these integrations, you will need to set up the selected apps and configure them for use. 

### Databases

Ductape allows you to create direct interfaces with your databases and perform atomic **database actions** on said databases to provide more reusable functionalities that would fast track development

### Notifications

Ductape allows you to easily handle notifications to your clients with the following formats

- Push Notifications
- Emails
- Webhooks


### Jobs

Ductape enables you to effortlessly define long-running jobs, automate their execution, and scale them as needed. It also provides robust features like retry mechanisms, and the ability to stop and start jobs, ensuring greater control and reliability in your workflows.

### Function

Functions in Ductape are reusable pieces of code that can be executed within the platform. Currently, Ductape supports functions written in Node.js, with plans to expand support for additional programming languages in the future. These functions can be used to streamline processes and encapsulate logic for reuse across different workflows.

### Caches

Ductape provides tools for easily building and monitoring data caches, optimizing performance by reducing the need for repeated data retrieval. This caching mechanism allows for faster execution of tasks and ensures efficient use of resources by minimizing redundant operations.

## Features

Features are a core offering of Ductape. With Ductape, you can combine various components—such as functions, integrations, and jobs—to create seamless execution workflows in code that can be easily reused. Features represent a collection of sequences that can be executed either in a defined order or concurrently, depending on your configuration. This flexibility allows you to build robust, scalable solutions tailored to your specific needs.
