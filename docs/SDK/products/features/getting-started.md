# Features in Ductape

In Ductape, a **product** is essentially a collection of features, with each feature representing a specific unit of functionality. A feature is a sequence of actions and events that are processed in a particular order to accomplish a defined task.

### Primary Components of a Feature

A feature in Ductape is composed of three key components:

1. **Input**: The data or parameters required to initiate the feature's sequence.
2. **Event Sequence**: A series of actions and events that are executed sequentially to process the input and achieve the feature's objective.
3. **Output**: The final result or outcome produced after the event sequence has been executed.

In this section, we will cover how to define each of these components in detail, and explore the wide range of functionalities that can be created using these building blocks.
