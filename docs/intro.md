Let's discover **Ductape in less than 5 minutes**.

## About Ductape
Ductape is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) framework designed to help teams rapidly scale and manage their third-party products

Ductape enables you to easily create reusable components from your existing APIs, databases, event managers, and microservices. With Ductape, you can enhance your product offerings by using simple, code-based interfaces and functions to connect multiple components, creating more complex and scalable solutions. This approach reduces the complexity of developing new features from scratch and streamlines your development process.

## How Ductape works

Ductape abstracts away a lot of the complications around integrating APIs. It comes with components that allow you to break an API collection into ACTIONS and join these ACTIONS to build FEATURES which are a collection of functionalities that execute custom logic defined by the user or define JOBS which are long running processes that are executed at certain times or run over a long period of time.  

These components allow you to add features to your products, orchestrate your various microservices and define and monitor your long running workflows much quicker than you could using traditional methods

Ductape also gives you the tools you need to handle your credentials, create and define your different environments and view your logs so that you can be able to quickly trace any errors that you might face.
