# Platform

Ductape consists of four main services, each playing a crucial role in providing a seamless product workflow for developers and their non-technical partners:

1. **Ductape SDK**: 
   - The Software Development Kit (SDK) provides a set of tools, libraries, and documentation that developers use to build and customize their products. It simplifies the development process by offering pre-built templates and components, reducing the time required to create robust products.

2. **Ductape CLI**:
   - The Command Line Interface (CLI) allows developers to interact with Ductape's platform directly from their terminal. It provides commands for managing products, deploying services, and automating various tasks, enhancing efficiency and control over the product process.

3. **Ductape Cloud**:
   - The backend component is the core of Ductape, handling all server-side operations. It manages data storage, processing, and communication between different services. The backend ensures that products run smoothly, securely, and reliably, supporting scalability and high performance.

4. **Ductape Web**:
   - The frontend component offers a user-friendly interface for both developers and non-technical users. It allows users to configure, monitor, and manage their products through an intuitive dashboard. This interface bridges the gap between technical and non-technical team members, facilitating collaboration and ease of use.
