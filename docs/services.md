8.	**Add Apps to Integration with Access Tags:** Connect each app to your integration using the generated access tags, ensuring smooth and secure interactions between services.
9.	**Map Integration Environments:** Match each app to specific environments within the integration, allowing you to test and deploy across multiple stages.
10. **Configure Integration Authentication:** Set up global authentication rules for the integration, streamlining secure access across all connected apps.
11. **Define Features:** Create specific features within the integration that group together multiple actions, making them reusable across functionalities.
12. **Set Up Caches:** Configure caching for frequently used data, reducing latency and improving performance.
